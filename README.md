<h1>Applied Data Science Capstone</h1>

***I am thrilled to present the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project***, a culmination of the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout this remarkable program. **This is no mere academic exercise, but a chance to demonstrate the true power of data science in driving innovation and cost savings in the aerospace industry.**

***The primary objective of this project is to predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings.*** 
<h2>Why, you ask?</h2>
Well, my friends, SpaceX's revolutionary reusability has allowed them to offer launch services at a mere $62 million, while their competitors charge upwards of $165 million. 
<p>
<strong>  By accurately forecasting these landings, we can the estimate launch costs , develop a correct prediction of the possibility of retreiving an alike falcon 9 first stage of the launch rocket , providing invaluable insights to companies seeking to compete with the trailblazing SpaceX</strong>.

    This capstone project consolidates the skills I have acquired throughout the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate -  <strong> from data collection and cleaning to machine learning model development and effective communication </strong>strong>. Truly, a well-rounded education that has prepared me to tackle the challenges of the modern world.

<p>
    <strong>As I embark on this exciting endeavor, I am filled with a sense of purpose and determination. For in mastering the techniques of data science, I shall unlock the door to a future of boundless possibilities</strong>. This is not just an academic exercise, but a chance to make a tangible impact on the aerospace industry and beyond. I am ready to rise to the challenge and demonstrate the transformative power of data science. The future is ours to shape, and I am eager to lead the way.
