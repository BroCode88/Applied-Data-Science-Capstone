<h1>IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project</h1>

**Project Overview**

Welcome to the final capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate! In this project, **we aim to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. This prediction is crucial because SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of its rockets significantly reduces launch costs. While SpaceX advertises a launch cost of $62 million, other providers charge upwards of $165 million per launch. By determining the likelihood of a successful landing, we can estimate the cost of a launch and provide valuable insights for companies competing with SpaceX for rocket launch bids.
Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to apply the data science methodology to predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings. This involves:
Collecting and preprocessing data from an API.
Ensuring the data is in the correct format for analysis.
Building machine learning models to make predictions.
Summarizing the results for business stakeholders to inform decision-making 
.

**Why This Matters**

**SpaceX's innovation in reusability has revolutionized the aerospace industry. By accurately predicting the success of first-stage landings, we can:
Assess the cost-effectiveness of SpaceX launches
Provide actionable insights for competitors in the aerospace market.
Demonstrate the practical application of data science in solving real-world problems.**
Example Scenario
An example of a successful launch includes the Falcon 9 rocket lifting off, completing its mission, and the first stage returning to land safely on a drone ship or landing pad. This reusability is a key factor in SpaceX's competitive pricing 
.

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
This capstone project consolidates all the skills learned throughout the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, including:
Data collection and cleaning.
Exploratory data analysis.
Feature engineering.
Machine learning model development and evaluation.
Communicating results effectively to stakeholders 
.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This capstone project is not just an academic exercise but a practical demonstration of how data science can drive innovation and cost savings in the aerospace industry. By completing this project, you will have gained hands-on experience in solving a complex, real-world problem using data science techniques.
